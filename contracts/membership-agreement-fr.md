- The establishment and management of an electronic payment network for the Brussels region.

To achieve these objectives, the Association may undertake any initiative, directly or indirectly, related to or likely to promote these goals, including but not limited to:
- Developing and maintaining software to ensure the payment network’s functionality.
- Promoting and training potential users of the network.

### Title II: Members

#### Section 1: Admission

**Article 6**
The Association consists of Full Members (Membres Effectifs) and, where applicable, Supporting Members (Membres Adhérents). Full Members and Supporting Members together form the Association’s members. The founders are the initial Full Members. The minimum number of Full Members cannot be less than two. Only Full Members enjoy the full rights granted by law and these statutes.

**Article 7**
Full Members include:
- The founding members; and
- Any Supporting Member nominated by at least two Full Members and admitted as a Full Member by a General Assembly decision with a three-quarters majority of votes present or represented.

**Article 8**
Supporting Members are individuals or entities wishing to assist the Association or participate in its activities, agreeing to abide by its statutes and decisions. Admission as a Supporting Member requires a written request to a Full Member. The Board of Directors or, if necessary, the General Assembly decides on admission at its sole discretion, without obligation to justify or allow appeal.

**Article 9**
Supporting Members have only the rights and obligations outlined in the statutes and lack voting rights at the General Assembly. Membership is finalized only after payment of a fee, the amount of which is set annually by the Board of Directors.

#### Section 2: Resignation, Exclusion, Suspension

**Article 10**
Members may resign at any time without justification by providing written notice to the Board of Directors. A member is deemed to have resigned if they fail to pay their required fee within one month of a reminder sent by regular mail or email. Exclusion, for reasons other than non-payment, requires a General Assembly decision with at least two-thirds of Full Members present or represented and a two-thirds majority vote. Exclusion must be noted in the meeting notice. The Board of Directors may suspend members for breaches of the law, statutes, or internal rules until the next General Assembly decides on exclusion. Resigned, suspended, or excluded members, and heirs of deceased members, have no claim to the Association’s assets or reimbursement of fees paid.

### Title III: Fees

**Article 11**
Full Members and Supporting Members may be required to pay an annual fee, capped at €10,000. The fee amount, which may differ between Full and Supporting Members and be set monthly or annually, is determined by the Board of Directors.
