# General Conditions for Businesses Joining Brussels Pay ASBL

## Introduction

These General Conditions govern the participation of businesses ("the Business") in the Brussels Pay ASBL ("the Association"), a non-profit organization located at 51 Rue de la Madeleine, 1000 Brussels, registered under Belgian Moniteur number 1017.806.251. The Association aims to establish and manage an electronic payment network for the Brussels region. By joining, the Business agrees to collaborate in the implementation, development, and promotion of this network under the terms outlined below.

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of these General Conditions is to define the terms under which the Business collaborates with the Association to support the rollout, development, and promotion of the Brussels Pay electronic payment network, leveraging the Business’s infrastructure and resources where applicable.

## 2. Services and Features Available to Businesses

The Association provides the following systems and features to participating businesses to facilitate the use of the Brussels Pay payment network:

- **Brussels Pay QR Code + Online Payment**: A web application accessible by scanning a QR code placed at business counters. Customers can place orders and pay using traditional payment methods (e.g., credit cards) without preloading a wallet. Businesses gain access to a clear overview of incoming orders and payment statuses via a dashboard. This self-service payment feature enhances flexibility beyond typical payment solutions.
- **Brussels Pay Mobile App**: Customers can download a mobile app to add EURb tokens to their account balance, which can then be used for payments at participating businesses.
- **Brussels Pay Point-of-Sale (POS) App**: Businesses can accept EURb payments using a QR code or opt for a POS app installed on Android phones or dedicated terminals. This provides a user experience similar to traditional electronic payment systems, with the option to print receipts.
- **NFC Card Wallets**: Customers can use NFC cards loaded with EURb tokens via contact with a phone. These cards support tap-to-pay functionality at participating businesses.
- **Viva Wallet Terminal Integration**: For businesses preferring a single device for all payments, integration with Viva Wallet terminals allows acceptance of traditional card payments, which are converted into EURb for the network.

### How the EURb Token Works
- EURb is a digital token used within the Brussels Pay network. Customers can acquire EURb through the mobile app or NFC cards and use it for transactions at participating businesses.
- Businesses receive EURb payments, which can be tracked and managed via the Brussels Pay dashboard.

### How Payouts Work
- Payments received in EURb are recorded in the Business’s account. Payouts to the Business’s bank account (in EUR) are processed periodically, subject to the Association’s operational schedule and any applicable fees.

### Ensuring Legality
- The Association ensures all transactions comply with Belgian and European laws, including data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR). Businesses must also adhere to these legal standards when using the network.

### Setting Expectations
- The systems are designed for ease of use and accessibility, adapting to various business needs. However, availability may depend on technical maintenance or third-party services, for which the Association is not liable.

### Fees
- A monthly fee is charged based on transaction volume to sustain the network:
  | Number of Transactions | Monthly Fee     |
  |-----------------------|-----------------|
  | 1–1,000              | €20/month       |
  | 1,001–2,000          | €30/month       |
  | 2,001–3,000          | €40/month       |
  | And so on            | +€10/month per additional 1,000 transactions |
- Fees may evolve over time, with prior notification to businesses, allowing withdrawal if desired.
- Additional transaction fees may apply depending on the payment method (e.g., Viva Wallet processing fees).

### Administrative Dashboard
- Businesses gain access to a dynamic dashboard (my.pay.brussels) to manage transactions, integrate EURb payments into accounting systems, and generate payment reports.

## 3. Obligations of the Parties

### 3.1 Obligations of the Business
- Add the Brussels Pay network as an accepted payment method alongside existing options.
- Promote the network to customers, encouraging its adoption and use.
- Provide feedback on the network’s performance to aid its improvement.
- Where feasible, encourage other businesses to join the project.

### 3.2 Obligations of the Association
- Provide technical information and specifications for implementing and using the payment network.
- Monitor network performance and notify the Business of any issues.
- Ensure transaction security and legal compliance.
- Supply transaction data as needed for the Business’s records.

## 4. Duration

Participation begins upon acceptance of these General Conditions and continues for an initial period agreed upon registration (e.g., one year), renewable by mutual consent.

## 5. Fees and Payment Terms

As outlined in Section 2, the Business agrees to pay a monthly fee based on transaction volume. Payment can be made via:
- Direct Debit
- Bank Transfer (to an account specified upon registration)

The Association will provide payment instructions, including communication details and due dates, upon onboarding.

## 6. Intellectual Property

All intellectual property related to the Brussels Pay network, including software and processes, remains the property of the Association unless otherwise agreed in writing.

## 7. Confidentiality

The Business and the Association agree to keep confidential any sensitive information exchanged during participation, disclosing it only with prior written consent, except where required by law.

## 8. Liability and Warranties

- The Business is not liable for damages from network use unless caused by gross negligence or breach of these conditions.
- The Association ensures legal compliance but is not responsible for damages due to third-party service failures or unforeseen technical issues.

## 9. Termination

Participation may be terminated by either party with written notice under the following conditions:
- Voluntary withdrawal by the Business.
- Breach of obligations by either party.
- Bankruptcy or dissolution of the Business.

Upon termination, outstanding fees remain payable, and access to the network ceases.

## 10. General Provisions

- These conditions may be amended with mutual written agreement.
- Invalidity of one clause does not affect the others.

## 11. Jurisdiction

Disputes arising from these General Conditions will be resolved by the French-speaking Brussels Enterprise Court, with both parties waiving other jurisdictions.

## Acceptance

By joining Brussels Pay ASBL, the Business acknowledges and agrees to these General Conditions.
