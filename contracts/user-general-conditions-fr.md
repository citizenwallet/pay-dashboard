# General Terms and Conditions for the use of Brussels Pay app

## 1. Application of the General Terms and Conditions

These general terms and conditions (General Terms and Conditions) constitute an integral part of the Agreement regarding the use of Brussels Pay services. The General Terms and Conditions shall be applied unless the Participant and the Administrator have otherwise agreed in writing. The Agreement will enter into force when the Participant has approved the Agreement form submitted by the Administrator.

By registering yourself or your organisation, legal entity, natural person, or business as a Participant in this project, you agree to these general terms and conditions which you confirm to have read in advance and accepted. The rights and obligations arising from this agreement apply to all subsequent agreements you enter into regarding the Brussels Pay project.

## 2. Definitions

The following definitions shall apply to these General Terms and Conditions:

- **Agreement**: means the Membership form, the General Terms and Condition and the Price list provided to the Participant by the Administrator which jointly constitute the entire Agreement regarding the use of Brussels Pay.
- **Participant(s)**: there are 2 main categories of participants in Brussels Pay, namely Private Individuals and Professionals:
  - **"Private Individuals"**: citizens who voluntarily participate in the Brussels Pay pilot project. Anyone who registers as a Private Individual confirms through acceptance of these terms and conditions that they have reached the minimum age of 18 and are not in a state of legal incapacity (extended minority, protective measure such as guardianship, ...).
  - **"Professionals"**: the network of professional participants, such as retail, businesses, hospitality, enterprises, traders, de facto associations, organizations, public services, ... who are active within the Operating Area and can receive transactions. To register as a Professional, the professional participant must submit a prior application to the Administrator via Brussels Pay website [https://www.pay.brussels/pre-register](https://www.pay.brussels/pre-register), which will be processed within a week. The pilot project works with a closed list of Professional participants designated by the Administrator.
- **Administrator**: Brussels Pay ASBL as initiator, owner, and manager of the project or any party to whom Brussels Pay has partially or fully delegated the management of the project. The administrator itself is also considered a Partner.
- **Payment Platform**: the secure website and application where Participants can register and execute local payment transactions.
- **App profile**: to enable transactions with our payment platform, Participants are assigned an app profile (login name, phone number, email address) which grants access to their personal account. This profile is always electronically available via the application and can be modified by the participant.
- **Personal Data**: means any information relating to an identified or identifiable person, and which is collected in connection to the Supplier’s provision of the Service. Personal Data may include but is not limited to, data collected for the purpose of transmitting Participants’ payment transactions.

## 3. General Obligations of the Participant

### 3.1. Professionals

The Professional Participant is responsible for the implementation of Brussels Pay. He must at all times comply with the requirements and specifications stated by the Administrator for the use of the Service.

The Professional Participant has to inform the Administrator in writing and without undue delay of any change in information that may affect the Agreement, including but not limited to changes to the Participant’s address, telephone number, and e-mail address. The Participant is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the information supplied to the Administrator.

### 3.2. Private Individuals

The Participant must use the Account and Platform as a prudent and reasonable person. It is forbidden to use the Platform in an improper manner, for an unlawful purpose, or in a way that violates the general terms and conditions or other legal provisions applicable to an electronic payment instrument.
If improper use or fraud is detected, the Account will be blocked. After detection of fraud or improper use, however, the Participant will be given the opportunity to submit their comments to the Administrator within a period of 15 days.

## 4. General Obligations of the Administrator

The Administrator will establish, manage and provide the Brussels Pay electronic payment network for the Brussels region. The Administrator shall ensure that its network meets the requirements specified by the authorities and both national and European legislation.

The Supplier shall not be responsible for the functionality or availability of third-party services, e.g. telecommunication services or services of card payment acquirers and other payment method providers.

The Administrator shall provide support to the Participants. Support may be subject to a separate charge. The Administrator is entitled to interrupt the use of the Service if necessary due to maintenance, security breach, repair or development of the network or if there is another justified reason for an interruption. The Administrator notifies the Participants of any interruption in the use of the Service in advance, if possible. The Administrator informs the Participants of significant changes to the network that imply modifications in its use thirty (30) days prior to the change taking effect.

## 5. Intellectual Property Rights

All intellectual property rights of Brussels Pay’s Payment Network and associated documentation are property of the Administrator, and no such rights will be transferred to the Participant under this Agreement.

## 6. Account Termination

Each Participant is always entitled to terminate their Account by having their registration deactivated.

The Private Individual can do this at any time by sending an email to …. with the notification to terminate their account. As of the effective date of termination, the Private Individual's Account is immediately blocked and simultaneously all rights linked to this Account expire.

All outstanding debts can still be credited from the Private Individual's account via the SEPA mandate. When the Private Individual has fulfilled their debt, this SEPA mandate will also be terminated.

## 7. Fraud

The Participant confirms that all personal data and/or administrative data that they register with the Administrator is correct and accurate. The Administrator cannot be held responsible for this and cannot be held liable for any damage that might result from the provision of incorrect contact details.
It is forbidden for the Participant to use the Platform in an improper manner, for an unlawful purpose, or in a way that violates these general terms and conditions or other legal provisions applicable to electronic payment instruments. After detection of fraud or improper use, however, the Participant will be given the opportunity to submit their comments to the Administrator within a period of 15 days. However, the administrator cannot be held liable for any damage that may result from such improper or fraudulent use of the Account that can be wholly or partially attributed to the Participant.

## 8. Misuse

The Administrator is entitled, without prejudice to all other rights, to immediately terminate the Participant's registration in case of fraud, providing incomplete or incorrect information to other Participants, if the Participant acts in violation of these conditions, if the Participant misuses the rights they have as a Participant, or if the Participant acts in any other way causing damage to other Participants.
To detect potentially suspicious use of the payment platform, random checks may be conducted. Upon detection of fraud, the Administrator can block the account at any time. The Participant is informed of this via (electronic) correspondence.

## 9. Limitation of Liability

The Administrator strives to provide optimal availability of the payment platform. If, despite all efforts made, the system should still not be available, neither the Administrator nor the Partners can be held liable for any damage suffered or inconvenience experienced. The Administrator's liability in this regard is thus limited to an obligation of means which consists of offering the service to the best of its ability under the conditions and modalities of these general terms and conditions.

Unless there is intent and/or gross negligence on the part of the Administrator, the Administrator can only be held liable for foreseeable damage that is the immediate and direct result of an attributable failure to comply with one or more obligations under this agreement. The liability for such direct damage is in any case limited to the available balance of local transactions on the account per cause of damage.

The Administrator shall not be liable to the Merchant for any damage caused by the suspension of the Service under section 7. The Administrator is responsible solely for its own services and actions. The Administrator is therefore under no circumstances liable for any errors/defects or delays, or otherwise for failure to fulfil its obligations, to the extent that this is the result of the actions of the Participant or a third party.

## 10. Force majeure

The Administrator is not liable for losses incurred as a result of failure to comply with its obligations in connection with circumstances beyond his control. The Administrator cannot be held responsible for losses incurred as a result of:

- breakdown of or lack of access to IT systems, or of damage to the data maintained in these systems as a result of any of the reasons listed below, irrespective of whether the Administrator or a third party is responsible for the operation of such systems,
- a power supply failure or failure in the Supplier’s telecommunications systems, legislative or administrative interventions, natural disasters, war, revolution, civil unrest, sabotage, terrorism or vandalism (including virus attacks and computer hacking),
- strikes, lockouts, boycotts or blockades that may affect the Administrator’s activities.

## 11. Amendments

The Administrator may amend these General Terms and Conditions with thirty (30) days prior notice. Shorter notice may be given, if such amendment is in response to requirements from the public authorities or for important security reasons. Notice is not required if the change is of minor importance or advantageous to the Participant. Unless the change is due to a compelling requirement by legislation, regulation, or an order or decision by an authority, the Participant shall be entitled to terminate the Agreement before the change becomes effective by submitting a written notice to the Administrator. If the Participant has not terminated the Agreement in writing before the change becomes effective, the Participant shall be deemed to have agreed to the new terms and conditions and he shall be bound by the new provisions of the Agreement.

## 12. Notices

Any notice by the Administrator to the Participant under the Agreement should be issued in a written form. The Participant is therefore obliged to provide the Administrator with contact information to which such notice can be sent. The Participant is obliged to inform the Administrator of any changes on the contact information provided.

## 13. Data Protection

### 13.1

Personal data related to the Participant will be processed by the Administrator:

i) in order to provide the services and fulfil the obligations under the agreement,
ii) for making customer analyses and participants’ follow-ups,
iii) for process development,
iv) for carrying out risk assessment and management,
v) for marketing purposes (subject to applicable law).

The personal data includes information processed for the purposes of onboarding, support, etc. The Professional Participants accept an obligation to inform its employees and other representatives about the disclosure of personal data to the Administrator as part of the agreement for the above purposes.

### 13.2

Personal data of the Professional Participants’ customers can be shared with/ processed by the Administrator if relevant or necessary for the Payment Network management. The personal data includes transaction data, including card and other payment data.

## 14. Confidentiality

Each party agrees to maintain confidentiality with respect to information of a confidential nature provided by the other party. The duty of confidentiality applies unless otherwise agreed or in cases where a party is required to disclose such information by law, regulation or a decision taken by public authority, or where the information in question is already publicly available and this fact cannot be attributed to the other party’s breach of contract.

The Administrator is entitled to disclose information about the Participant for the purposes of meeting the applicable compliance and security requirements and for providing the agreed services to the Participant.

## 15. Other Terms

The Administrator is entitled to check the Participants’s personal, legal and economic information upon entering into the Agreement and during the term thereof in order to ensure the Participant is able to comply with its obligations under the Agreement.

The Participant must ask permission to the Administrator prior to using the Brussels Pay name and logo and wait for its approval before doing so.

The Participant is not entitled to assign or in any other way transfer the Agreement to a third party, whether in whole or in part without the Administrator’s prior written consent.

## 16. Applicable Law and Resolution of Conflicts

If a dispute arises, attempts will always first be made – on penalty of inadmissibility of any subsequent legal proceedings – to seek an amicable solution through consultation with the Administrator. The parties involved will first contact the Administrator and respect the utmost discretion in this regard.

If this attempt to reach an amicable settlement does not lead to a solution, the dispute will be submitted to the ordinary Courts. The Courts and Tribunals of the judicial district where the administrator has its registered office have exclusive jurisdiction to hear any dispute arising from or relating to these general terms and conditions.

In case of disputes arising between the Participants (Professionals and Private Individuals) among themselves, the Participant undertakes to indemnify the Administrator against all possible claims and damages that might arise against the Administrator or that might be related thereto. This indemnification obligation applies to all current and future claims and compensations regardless of their nature (foreseeable and unforeseen, known and unknown).

## 17. The Validity of the General Terms and Conditions

These General Terms and Conditions shall replace any previous versions and any other provisions applied between the Administrator and the Participant when they enter into force. They are valid until the official termination of the Participant's use of the Brussels Pay network (please refer to article 6, 7 and 8 for further information about termination).
